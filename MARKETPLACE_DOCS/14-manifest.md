# Manifest

## Definition

A manifest is a file which describes an add-on and its functionalities.
Through the manifest you can define how your add-on integrates with Clockify.

### Schema

While there are several manifest schema versions available, you should always aim to support and use the latest version of the manifest schema.
At the time of writing, the latest manifest schema version is version ***1.5.1***. This section will describe version 1.5.1 of the manifest schema.

The manifest schema is defined in the [json schema](https://json-schema.org/) format and can be retrieved at any time from the Clockify developer API by calling the following endpoint:

```
GET https://developer.clockify.me/api/addons/manifest-schema
```

You can use the schema above to validate your manifest file and explore the different available options.

***Versions***

In specific circumstances (such as for compatibility reasons), you might want to use a previous version of the schema.
To do so, you have to explicitly define the `schemaVersion` attribute on the manifest.

To access a specific version of the manifest schema, you can call the following endpoint with the version parameter:

```
GET https://developer.clockify.me/api/addons/manifest-schema?version=1.5.1
```

      "path": "/new-client"
    }
]
```

> You can have a maximum of 20 webhooks per add-on.

## Settings

Add-on settings allow the add-on to present the user with a configuration screen where add-on specific settings can be configured.
If defined, settings will be shown under the menu dropdown of the add-on on the add-ons tab.

### Types

There are two types of settings an add-on can have:

- ***[structured settings](structured-settings.md)*** - you can configure the structure of the settings according to the settings [schema](#structured-settings). Clockify will take care of the persisting the settings.
- ***custom UI*** - you can configure a custom UI by supplying a string value as the value for the `settings` field. The value will be the path where the UI will be served. The custom settings UI will work the same way as [UI components](#components) do and will be loaded inside an iframe. If following this approach, you will be responsible for handling and storing your add-on's data.

## Subscription plan

Subscription plans represent the plans a workspace can be subscribed to on Clockify and the features that are available to said workspace.

Below is the list of plans that are currently supported:

- FREE
- BASIC
- STANDARD
- PRO
- ENTERPRISE

You can read more about the different subscription plans, and the features that are available to each plan, on the [following link](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans).

## Scopes

The scopes represent the permissions of an add-on and constrain the APIs and data that the add-on can access when interacting with the [Clockify API](https://docs.clockify.me/).
A scope consists of a resource and an action. Actions can be READ or WRITE.

> Requesting the WRITE permission for a resource does not automatically grant the add-on READ permission.

> Attempting to call endpoints without declaring the appropriate scopes on the manifest will result in the request failing with a status of HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN.

It should be noted that even if a specific feature is available on the workspace plan and the relevant scopes are requested, the feature still needs to be enabled in the workspace settings in order for the APIs for that feature to work.

Below is the list of scopes that an add-on can declare in its manifest:

- CLIENT_READ
- CLIENT_WRITE
- PROJECT_READ
- PROJECT_WRITE
- TAG_READ
- TAG_WRITE
- TASK_READ
- TASK_WRITE,
- TIME_ENTRY_READ
- TIME_ENTRY_WRITE
- EXPENSE_READ
- EXPENSE_WRITE
- INVOICE_READ
- INVOICE_WRITE
- USER_READ
- USER_WRITE
- GROUP_READ
- GROUP_WRITE
- WORKSPACE_READ

- CUSTOM_FIELDS_READ
- CUSTOM_FIELDS_WRITE
- APPROVAL_READ
